---

Create a comprehensive end-of-day work summary. Follow these steps:

## 1. Review Today's Work

Review our conversation history from today to identify:
- Tasks completed
- Code changes made
- Problems solved
- Decisions made
- Tools and technologies used
- Any blockers or open items

## 2. Check Memory Keeper (if available)

If memory-keeper is configured:
- Search memory-keeper-short for today's items
- Look for categories: `progress`, `decision`, `note`, `error`, `warning`, `task`
- Include high-priority items

## 3. Create Summary

Create a structured summary with these sections:

```markdown
# Daily Summary - [Date]

## Overview
[2-3 sentence summary of the day]

## Key Accomplishments
- [Accomplishment 1]
- [Accomplishment 2]

## Technical Work
- [Code changes, features, fixes]

## Decisions Made
- [Decision 1 with reasoning]

## Learnings
- [New insights or knowledge]

## Tomorrow's Focus
- [Items to carry forward]
- [Next steps]
```

## 4. Display Summary

Display the full summary so the user can review it.

## 5. Save (Optional)

Ask the user if they want to save the summary:
- To a file (ask for path)
- To memory-keeper for future reference
- Just display it (no save needed)

Make the summary informative but concise. Focus on substance over filler.
