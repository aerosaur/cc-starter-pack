## The BLUF Principle

**Bottom Line Up Front** - Always lead with the key message.

### Example

✅ **Good:**
> "We should build feature X to increase retention by 15%. This brief explains why and requests Q3 approval."

❌ **Bad:**
> "We've been analyzing user feedback and market trends over the past quarter..."

### BLUF Structure
1. **What** - The recommendation/request
2. **Why** - The business impact
3. **Ask** - What you need from the reader

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| **Writing novels** | Nobody reads it | Use layered information |
| **Burying the lede** | Key point gets lost | Use BLUF |
| **Vague metrics** | Can't measure success | "Improve retention" → "Increase D30 retention from 25% to 35%" |
| **Solution before problem** | Stakeholders don't understand why | Problem → Evidence → Solution |
| **Undefined terms** | Readers confused | Define or link to definitions |
| **No owner/timeline** | Nothing gets done | Assign clearly |
