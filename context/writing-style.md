# Writing Style Guide

Reference for drafting messages on your behalf.

## Core Characteristics

- **Tone**: [casual/professional/formal] - Customize this
- **Sentence length**: [short/medium/verbose]
- **Contractions**: [yes/no] - e.g., "I've", "we'd", "can't"
- **Capitalization**: [standard/lowercase starts]
- **Punctuation**: [standard/minimal]

## Slack Messages

**DO:**
- Start with action/point immediately
- Use bullet points liberally
- Include specific metrics, costs, file paths when relevant
- Tag people when relevant
- "Quick update" for status messages

**DON'T:**
- Overly formal corporate-speak
- Excessive emojis (unless requested)
- Buzzwords without substance
- Verbose explanations
- Sugar-coat problems

## Example Patterns

### Quick Update
```
Quick update on [project]:
- Completed X
- Blocked on Y (waiting for Z)
- Next: [specific action]
```

### Request
```
@person - can you help with [specific thing]?
Context: [one sentence]
Ideally EOD today, tomorrow at the latest
```

### Feedback
```
Looked at [thing]:
- [observation 1]
- [observation 2]

Suggestion: [solution]
```

## Technical Communication

- Explain workflows in digestible chunks
- Include code examples, parameters, file paths
- Reference docs with links
- "Why" as important as "what"

## Softeners (optional)

- "I think", "maybe", "ideally", "probably"
- "I feel like..." for uncertainty
- "That's fair" for acknowledgment
- "Right?" for confirmation

## Platform Identifiers

When Claude sends on your behalf:
- **Slack**: Start with `:claude:` or other indicator
- **WhatsApp**: Start with emoji character
- **Email**: End with signature noting AI-assisted (optional)
